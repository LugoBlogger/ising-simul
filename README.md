# 2D and 3D Ising simulation

This repository provides a better MATLAB code of Ising simulation. 
The first version of this code is copied from 
[(Jahangirov, 2018) - MSN 514 - Lecture 23 - Ising model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnw0Xlbj3JM)

## Directory description
- `fig-results` (all plots from the simulation). All the data result from the simulation are stored inside MATLAB figure files `*.fig`
- `ising-2D` (all MATLAB code for 2D Ising simulation). Inside this directory there is two files with prefix `*v2.m`. These files are the modification from the first version with several additional scripts to make a plot during the simulation.
